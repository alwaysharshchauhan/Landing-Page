        <h1>Web Development</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="pass">
        <p>Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as
            <br>web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an <br>
            application that works over the internet i.e. websites.</p><br>

            <p>The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:</p><br>

            <p>Web: It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.</p>
            <p>Development: It refers to building the application from scratch.</p><br>

        <p>Web Development can be classified into two ways:</p><br>
        <p>Frontend Development</p>
        <p>Backend Development</p><br>

<h2>Frontend Development</h2><br>
The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the <br>
‘client side’ of the application.<br><br>

<img class="front" src="Front-End-Frameworks-and-Libraries1.png" alt="Frontend Img">

<h3>Popular Frontend Technologies :</h3><br>

<p>HTML: HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of<br>
 web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the <br>
 structure of a website.</p><br>
<p>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to<br>
simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</p><br>
<p>JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language used to provide a dynamic behavior to our website.</p><br>
<p>Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and<br>
 web applications. It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first <br>
 websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all <br>
 sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).</p><br>

 <h2>Backend Development</h2><br>
 <p>Backend is the server side of a website. It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with.<br> 
 It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and<br>
 arrange data.</p><br>

 <img class="backend" src="Backend-design-roadmap.jpeg" alt="Backend Img">

 <h3>Popular Backend Technologies :</h3><br>
<p>PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.<br><br>
Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages. It is highly scalable.<br><br>
Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.<br><br>
Node.js: Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript<br>
code outside a browser.</p><br>

<h2>Databases</h2><br>
In web technology, a database is a structured collection of data that is stored electronically and accessed<br>
 via a web application. It serves as the backend component where data is stored, managed, and retrieved.<br>
  Databases can be relational (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) using structured tables and SQL for queries, or <br>
  non-relational (like MongoDB, CouchDB) which store data in flexible, document-oriented formats. They <br>
  enable web applications to handle dynamic content, user data, transactions, and more by providing <br>
  efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation capabilities. Database management systems (DBMS) are <br>
  used to interact with the database, ensuring data integrity, security, and performance.<br><br>

  <h3>Relational Database</h3><br>
  <p>A relational database stores data in tables, similar to a spreadsheet, where each table has rows and<br>
     columns. The rows hold individual records, and the columns define the data attributes. Tables can be<br>
      linked to each other through special keys, allowing related data to be connected.<br><br>

    Postgre SQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database that supports advanced SQL<br>
     features and complex queries. It handles structured data, ensures ACID compliance, and is known for<br>
    its reliability and extensibility.<br><br>

    MariaDB: MariaDB is an open-source relational database that evolved from MySQL, offering improved <br>
    performance, security, and features. It supports SQL queries, ACID compliance, and is highly<br>
    compatible with MySQL.<br><br>

    MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that uses SQL for <br>
    managing structured data. It’s known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, widely used <br>
    in web applications.</p><br>

    <h2>NoSql Database</h2><br>
    <p>A NoSQL database stores data in a flexible, non-tabular format, unlike traditional relational databases.<br>
        Instead of using tables with rows and columns, NoSQL databases might use documents, key-value pairs,<br>
        wide-columns, or graphs to store data. This allows them to handle large amounts of unstructured or <br>
        semi-structured data efficiently. They are designed to scale easily and manage big data applications.<br><br>

Mongodb: MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents. It handles <br>
unstructured data, supports powerful queries, and scales easily across servers, making it popular for<br>
flexible, scalable applications.<br><br>

Cassandra: Apache Cassandra is an open-source NoSQL database that is used for handling big data. <br>
It has the capability to handle structure, semi-structured, and unstructured data.<br><br>

Redis: Redis is an in-memory NoSQL database known for its speed. It supports various data structures <br>
like strings, hashes, and lists, making it ideal for caching, real-time analytics, and messaging.
